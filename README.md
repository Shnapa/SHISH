This project explores how ChatGPT responds depending on:

the type and structure of the prompt,
the complexity of the IT-related task,
and the availability of similar problems/solutions online.
The goal is to understand how effectively ChatGPT solves technical problems based on these factors, and how to improve prompt engineering for better results.
